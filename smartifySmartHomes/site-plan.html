      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
          Do you want the luxury and convenience of a smart home without the hassle of DIY installations or expensive subscription fees?
          At Smartify Smarthomes we install and smartify your lights, locks, garage door opener, plugs, or security system all for an 
          affordable one time fee. Control your entire home from your phone, with your voice, or through custom automations. For more 
          information or to get a free instant bid, visit our website or give us a call today!
        </p>


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>
        We'll probably lean towards customers ages 35+, both male and female. More importantly our intended audience is made up of homeowners. 
        We'll especially target areas with larger, wealthier homes. The younger half of our audience we will target with appeals such as 
        convenience, home improvement, and adding value to your home. To the older half of our audience we will focus on the accessibility 
        benefits of being able to control your entire home by voice or smartphone.

        <strong>What types of activities will visitors want to complete on your site?</strong> - Get customer support<br>
        <strong>Why will your visitors come to your site instead of another to get this information or complete the actions?</strong> - Other sites that I’ve seen don’t really give a straight up price. They require an in person bid. It takes a lot more commitment from a customer to accept someone coming to their house and giving a bid than it does for them to do it online. In marketing you want them to just give into your idea a little bit at a time. First they just click on the ad. The next time they do the insta-bid. The next time they let someone go to their house. If a customer has to jump straight into letting someone come to their house you will probably have a lot less conversions.<br>

      <p>
        <strong>Why will people come to your site?</strong> - Visit our site for a 2 minute online insta-bid. Just select what smart devices you would like, enter the number of rooms you want to smartify, number of doors in your house, if you have a garage door, and instantly see how much it will cost you.<br>
        <strong>What questions will your visitors expect your site to answer for them?</strong> - It will show how much it would cost to smartify someone’s entire home how they want it with the insta-bid. <br>
        <strong>What types of activities will visitors want to complete on your site?</strong> - Do the insta-bid<br>
        <strong>What information is necessary to complete any actions your site offers?</strong> - It would probably be good to require at least an email address to complete the insta-bid. Possibly first and last name too. Anyone completing an insta-bid has at least some interest and would then be in a warm market. With their email address we could retarget them through email marketing and social media advertising.<br>
